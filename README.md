# Thank you for choosing RXBot! Visit our website to get started with our Setup Guide: https://rxbots.net/rxbot-setup.html

RXBot is a song request bot for Twitch streamers: viewers can request songs in chat, and they will be added to a queue for the streamer to listen to while they stream. What makes RXBot unique is that it supports not only YouTube, but Google Play Music as well (though you must have a subscription to use that functionality). It's also very lightweight, so it will have virtually no impact on system performance.

We also plan on turning RXBot into a full-blown chatbot, so stay tuned!
