RXBot is a song request bot for Twitch streamers: viewers can request songs in chat, and they will be added to a queue for the streamer to listen to while they stream. What makes RXBot unique is that it supports not only YouTube, but Google Play Music as well (though you must have a subscription to use that functionality). It's also very lightweight, so it will have virtually no impact on system performance.

We also plan on turning RXBot into a full-blown chatbot, so stay tuned!

RXBot is a multi-purpose IRC bot for the video game streaming service Twitch. It's primarily focused on song request- allowing stream viewers to request any song of their choice from Google Play Music, Youtube, or just any online music file. 
Unfortunately, since Google has chosen to discontinue Google Play Music, RXBot is no longer being updated. The code is old and less clean than IntRX, but fully functional and quite stable nonetheless.
