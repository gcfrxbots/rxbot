VERSION 2.1

Primary Change Focus: TIMING

Changes:

SONGREQUEST:
All songs are now stored in the database table with a "time" value in ms. This allows the time to be referenced whenever needed.
When songs are tested for timing, they must be 'played' for 0.02 seconds. This should be short enough that most computers won't detect it, but needs testing on much slower CPUs.
Songs now have a configurable maximum time, adjustable in Settings as MAXTIME. 

COMMANDS:
Fixed !volume 0 returning the current volume due to python thinking 0 is the same as None
Added DEFAULT_SR_MSG to settings, so that a user just typing !sr or !songrequest in chat won't request "", but instead get a configurable message with instructions about songrequest.

Added !timeleft [id]. Typing the command will return the hours/min/seconds total of all songs in the queue, or send a message if there are no songs. 
!timeleft [id] will return the time up until the song with the given id (not including it) so that users may know how much time remains until their request.
