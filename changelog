VERSION 3.1

Primary Change: Youtube Search Changes
Changes:

PlaylistEditor now has an option to show you your playlist.
PlaylistEditor is now functional without logging into GPM.
Fixed the youtube-dl updater to use `py -3.7 -m pip` rather than just `pip`
Added more checks on startup. It now detects if your oauth is incorrect and instructs you how to fix, as well as checking hotkey formatting.


SONGREQUEST:
I found out that gmusicapi DOES requrie you to be a subscriber to search youtube. Rewrote youtube search to use youtube-dl so no login is required.
Fixed a bug that'd cause the bot to occasionally crash when using sr or plsr
If for any reason your song's ID is "err" please report it immediately

COMMANDS:
No changes to commands
