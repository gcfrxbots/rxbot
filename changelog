VERSION 2.0

Primary Change Focus: REWRITE

Changes:

SONGREQUEST:
Rewrote pretty much all song request functions into a class to make managing variables and function calls much easier
Moved the actual playing of audio from Run.py into SongRequest.py so that all song management functions can be done in one class
The SongRequest class is for all songrequest related commands. The SRControl class is for actual audio management, like playing/pausing.
Changed any command for the backup playlist to include !pl, such as !plsr to add songs and !plclearsong to delete it.
Fixed !sr with no arguments just requesting some random song. Added a customizeable message in Settings to send users info when they do this.

COMMANDS:
Rewrote how commands are executed: Rather than a giant if/else ladder each command is stored in a dict and that dict is scanned when a cmd is run.
This also allows for custom commands to be added extremely easily in the future.
Commands that are moderator-only have "MOD" as the first entry in their dict.
Readjusted how nowplaying.txt works. Rather than rewriting the file every second, it only rewrites it when theres a change. Which makes sense.
