VERSION 3.0

Primary Change: Rxbot3 Initial Release
Changes:

The bot now runs using Python 3.7! Uninstall 2.7 or run the bot using py -3.7 Run.py

The bot now has an initial checkup feature. When started, it will create or verify all of the required files and ensure everything is set up correctly.
Added a /Resources folder to put all of the files that are needed after the bot's first setup. Auto generates.
Renamed "songqueue.db" to "botData.db" since it'll be used for way more than the song queue in the future.
Added two new files, Bot.py and CustomCommands.py. Both are pretty empty now, but will be expanded upon later for more features.
Hotkeys have been overhauled to be much easier to use and more reliable. There's now a simple way to bind any chat command to any hotkey.


SONGREQUEST:
PyTube is GONE! Pafy and Youtube-Dl are now used.
Youtube-Dl NEEDS to be the newest version, so there's an auto updater built in on startup.

COMMANDS:
Reworked how the runcommand() function works to be more optimized, and to take all of it's input from strings so that the commands can be defined anywhere.
The commands library is now defined at the top of each file, currently SongRequest, Bot, and CustomCommands. This can be expanded infinitely.
CustomCommands.py has documentation in it and fully works to allow users to create their own custom functions and bot commands.

Special thanks to kc0zhq for the initial Py3 port and for help with this big update.
