VERSION 3.2.3

Primary Change: Console
Changes:

Commands can now be typed into the bot's console and be executed just as if they were typed into twitch chat.
The error catcher for any command-related errors used to just always output "Socket Error" - revised it to print the error.
3.2.3 - Fixed a few typos and cleaned up the code a bit, as well as improving stability when no backup playlist is used.

SONGREQUEST:
Fixed a very rare error that kept the bot from adding a song to the queue when that song was the next-up from the playlist.
3.2.2 - Hotfixed an error where any 'search' youtube command would crash the bot. I typo'd a SQL command, whoops.


COMMANDS:
Added a `quit` command into the CONSOLE (Does nothing in twitch chat). quit will pause the music, clear the nowplaying file, swap the album art to the generic image, and kill the bot.
3.2.3 - Lots of stuff would break if there was no music playing or paused, including the quit command. Fixed that.
