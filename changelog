VERSION 2.2.2

Primary Change Focus: BUGFIXES

Changes:

SONGREQUEST:
Probably fixed a very rare bug in which songs end slightly before they're supposed to. Added a short delay after the song is detected as over before it stops it.
Fixed a bug that caused the bot to crash when a song containing quotations in the title/artist was requested

No Changes
