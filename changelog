VERSION 3.2.2

Primary Change: Console
Changes:

Commands can now be typed into the bot's console and be executed just as if they were typed into twitch chat.
The error catcher for any command-related errors used to just always output "Socket Error" - revised it to print the error.

SONGREQUEST:
Fixed a very rare error that kept the bot from adding a song to the queue when that song was the next-up from the playlist.
3.2.2 - Hotfixed an error where any 'search' youtube command would crash the bot. I typo'd a SQL command, whoops.

COMMANDS:
Added a `quit` command into the CONSOLE (Does nothing in twitch chat). quit will pause the music, clear the nowplaying file, swap the album art to the generic image, and kill the bot.
