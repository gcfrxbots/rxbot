VERSION 2.2

Primary Change Focus: YOUTUBE UPGRADES

Changes:

SONGREQUEST:
Added a setting GPM_ENABLE which allows for the option to disable Google Play Music entirely. Remember to clear playlist/queue first.
Added a setting YT_IF_NO_RESULT which allows the bot to automatically search and play YT songs if a request isn't found on GPM.
Because sometimes GPM isn't able to properly bring up videos when requesting just YT id's, added a fallback to triple check that the request works.

Sped up requests for youtube and GPM slightly.
Fixed a bug where songs randomly skip less than a second after playing.
Hated VLC a lot for making my life incredibly difficult.

COMMANDS:
Added a potential bypass to commands so that a function can be run without sending a message back. Doesn't really change anything other than make my life easier.
Re-Added !clearqueue since I completely forgot to add it back during the rewrite. This clears the songrequest queue.


This will be the final release before advertising the bot to the public.
