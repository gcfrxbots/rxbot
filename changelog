VERSION 2.2.1

Primary Change Focus: EASE OF USE CHANGES

Changes:

SONGREQUEST:
Added a setting MEDIA_FILE_ENABLE to allow users to disable online hosted media files if they choose to.


COMMANDS:
Added !queue and setting QUEUE_LINK. Use any online backup service to automatically upload SongQueue.csv and put the link here so users can see it.
Added shorter aliases for the !volume, !volumeup, and !volumedown as !v, !vu, and !vd respectively.
Fixed the HK_CLRSONG "!clearsong" hotkey to send a message in chat when it's activated to let a user know that their request was cleared.
Cleaned up some of the wording in the Settings.py file to not mislead people.
Apparently Keyboard Scan codes don't actually work with the hotkeys. Whoops. Will be changing over to AHK's python lib soon.
