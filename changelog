VERSION 3.5

Primary Change: Quotes

SONGREQUEST:
Backup playlist is now visible and editable in BotData.xlsx
Before anyone asks, the "Key" in playlist corresponds to the key that google play uses to identify the song. This can be replaced with either a youtube key or a URL to a music file, and the bot will accept it.
Fixed a bug that caused a crash when typing "!sr" into the console.

PLAYLISTEDITOR:
Cleaned up code and looks, now 'resets' the view each time
Remove option to view the playlist, use BotData.xlsx for this
Script now properly syncs the xlsx and the db when changes are made.

BOT:
Re-added !uptime (or added it for the first time? Cant remember if it's existed before)
The "Game" column in the quotes table is currently unused but will be used in a future update.
Added quotes! !quote add or !addquote to insert a quote, !quote remove/delete # or !removequote # or !deletequote # to remove one. !quote # calls a specific one, !quote calls a random one.
When showing a random quote, the bot will specifically not show any one quote twice until every other quote has been displayed.
Created BotData.xlsx, which will always show the content inside of the bot's database.
More Info:
    WHEN THE BOT BOOTS it will clone this file to the database, so you can make changes and the bot will understand them.
    WHEN THE BOT MAKES CHANGES it will clone the contents of the database to this file.
    Edits should ONLY be made to BotData.xlsx when the bot is shut down, as the bot will sync all changes on startup and no other times.


OTHER CHANGES:
Changed the changelog to make more sense.
Added a new command permission, "STREAMER". This works the same was as putting "MOD" when defining commands, except it limits it to ONLY the user set as "Channel" in settings.
Continually refactored code to make old me's code suck less
Continually hated myself over old code too sloppy to be worth refactoring
The bot used to REQUIRE Install_Requirements to generate the Config folder and Settings.xlsx. It can now start without running Install_Requirements if all other libraries are installed.
Removed Herobrine
