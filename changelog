VERSION 3.3.1

Primary Change: EXE Files and Settings Fix
Changes:

Bot and PlaylistEditor are now run with compiled .exe files, so they have icons, look nicer, and can be easily run as Admin.
The batch scripts to run the bot are still located in the RxBot folder, in case you don't feel comfortable running the .exe
Okay, so I swear I'm good at coding, but literally everything related to updates in the new settings was broken. I uh, I fixed that. Probably.
Redid some things that would cause the bot to crash that would just send a simple chat message that got lost. They now all have their own events.


SONGREQUEST:
Fxed the FUCKING VLC error! WHOO! That error that constantly spammed the console from VLC? Finally found a way to shut it up!
Moved generic_art.jpg into the config folder, so users know they can replace it with anything else.
Added setting UPDATE PL ON START, and the functionality to, well, update the playlist on start. You NEED a GPM PLAYLIST set, and it'll automatically get any new songs from it when you start the bot.
Added !cq as an alias for !clearqueue



COMMANDS:
Probably didn't break anything
