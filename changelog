VERSION 3.2.1

Primary Change: Console
Changes:

Commands can now be typed into the bot's console and be executed just as if they were typed into twitch chat.
The error catcher for any command-related errors used to just always output "Socket Error" - revised it to print the error.

SONGREQUEST:
Fixed a very rare error that kept the bot from adding a song to the queue when that song was the next-up from the playlist.

COMMANDS:
No Changes
