VERSION 3.4

Primary Change: Volume Caching
Changes:
Cleaned up a few print statements to make the console just a bit cleaner

SONGREQUEST:
When playing Youtube or Online Media songs, you now have the a setting to enable volume caching.
This will save the volume of the last track played on GPM, since all songs are consistent. If the volume is adjusted for the Non-GPM song, the volume will be automatically changed back once it's over.


COMMANDS:
Probably didn't break anything
