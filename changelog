VERSION 2.3

Primary Change Focus: ALBUM ART

Changes:

Created the Output folder, where everything that changes lives. It's currently home to albumart.jpg, nowplaying.txt, and SongQueue.csv.
Make sure you have this folder or there will be errors.

SONGREQUEST:
Whenever a song is played, the Album Art for that song is downloaded and put into the Output folder.
If the song is not on google play music, the album art is set as a generic artwork. This is customizeable by editing generic_art.jpg, but keep it 512x512.

COMMANDS:
No Changes
