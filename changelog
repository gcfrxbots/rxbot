VERSION 2.4.4

Primary Change Focus: SSL + Fixes

Changes:

The bot is now capable of connecting to Twitch using SSL. When the port in Settings is set to 80 or 6667 a standard connection will be used,
or if the port is 443 or 6697 a SSL connection will be used.

SONGREQUEST:
PyTube sucks again, and occasionally gives a bad song which might occasionally result in songs not playing. Working on a fix soon, but for
now the getsongtime wont get stuck in an infinite loop if it breaks. Fixes the "Disconnecting" issue after a few hours.

COMMANDS:
No Changes
