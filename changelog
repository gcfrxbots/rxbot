VERSION 2.4

Primary Change Focus: SONGQUEUE FORMATTING

Changes:

All requirements should now be installed automatically. Upon starting the bot it'll check if there are any packages you don't have and automatically attempt to install them.
The bot now uses the 'xlsxwriter' package. It should install automatically.
Added timestamps to chat messages displayed in the console.
Fixed some potential encoding issues with sending messages and managing usernames with non-english characters.

SONGQUEUE:
Made some changes to how often the bot re-writes the SongQueue file. It's only as-needed now rather than constantly.
The SongQueue is no longer a .csv and is instead an .xlsx. This means it can incorporate formatting and just generally look WAY nicer.
The new SongQueue is formatted and has columns extended so things don't get cut off.
Wrote some HTML to properly embed the file in a website and crop out the ugly parts of the doc. Link here: https://rxbots.weebly.com/song-queue.html
